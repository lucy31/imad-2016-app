                <span style="font-size: 30pt">Hi!</span> I am <b>Lonika Ghosh</b> and this blog is meant for all foodies out there. We will try to explore all the vivid cuisines available as well as focus on particular dishes. Some mouth watering delicacies are about to be witnessed. If possible I would try pointing out the best places to have the same. Enjoy traversing through history as we move from traditional food to the fusion ones and explore the age old history they carry along.

            <h1>The Foodie Me</h1>
             <p>
                 I originally belong to the city famously known as the 'City of Joy' where people are known for their foodie nature as well as the sweet cravings. Fortunately enough I have travelled many places and hence have developed the love for food. My taste buds love it all, be it traditional or fusion. Furthermore I also like to cook and often end up discovering a new treat. Apart from this I love to read novels and take part in elocution contests. Last but not the least coding gets a big piece of the pie and keeps me all hooked up to the lappy.
             </p>           
            <h1>At Work</h1>
            <p>
                As of now I am a student and would be graduating in 2018 as a Engineer in the Computer Science stream. I have knowledge regarding C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL and presently am working on my object oriented skills for which I have also completed a workshop on Object Oriented Analysis and Design from NPTEL. My primary goal is to learn as I grow and am eager to get involved in work that will help achieve the same. Other than this I have also completed a course on Big Data Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence.
