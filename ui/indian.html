            Indian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to India. Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic group and occupations, these cuisines vary significantly from each other and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religious and cultural choices and traditions. There has also been Middle Eastern and Central Asian influence on North Indian cuisine from the years of Mughal rule. Indian cuisine has been and is still evolving, as a result of the nation's cultural interactions with other societies.

            Historical incidents such as foreign invasions, trade relations and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain foods to the country. For instance, the potato, a staple of the diet in some regions of India, was brought to India by the Portuguese, who also introduced chillies and breadfruit. Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe was the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.[6] Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia. Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from Middle East, North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, the British Isles, Fiji, and the Caribbean.

            <h1>The Foodie Me</h1>
             <p>
                 I originally belong to the city famously known as the 'City of Joy' where people are known for their foodie nature as well as the sweet cravings. Fortunately enough I have travelled many places and hence have developed the love for food. My taste buds love it all, be it traditional or fusion. Furthermore I also like to cook and often end up discovering a new treat. Apart from this I love to read novels and take part in elocution contests. Last but not the least coding gets a big piece of the pie and keeps me all hooked up to the lappy.

            <h1>At Work</h1>
            <p>
                As of now I am a student and would be graduating in 2018 as a Engineer in the Computer Science stream. I have knowledge regarding C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL and presently am working on my object oriented skills for which I have also completed a workshop on Object Oriented Analysis and Design from NPTEL. My primary goal is to learn as I grow and am eager to get involved in work that will help achieve the same. Other than this I have also completed a course on Big Data Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence.
