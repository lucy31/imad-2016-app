      <h2>Jammu and Kashmir</h2>
    <p>The cuisine of Jammu and Kashmir is from three regions of the state Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. Kashmiri cuisine has evolved over hundreds of years. Its first major influence was the food of the Kashmiri Hindus and Buddhists. The cuisine was later influenced by the cultures which arrived with the invasion of Kashmir by Timur from the area of modern Uzbekistan. Subsequent influences have included the cuisines of Central Asia and the North Indian plains. The most notable ingredient in Kashmiri cuisine is mutton, of which there are over 30 varieties. Wazwan is a multicourse meal in the Kashmiri tradition, the preparation of which is considered an art. Kashmiri Pandit food is elaborate, and an important part of the Pandits' ethnic identity. Kashmiri Pandit cuisine usually uses yogurt, oil, and spices such as turmeric, red chilli powder, cumin, ginger, and fennel, though they do not use onion and garlic.
