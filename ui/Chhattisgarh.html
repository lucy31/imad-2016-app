      <h2>Chhattisgarh</h2>
    <p>Chhattisgarh cuisine uses many foods not found in the rest of India, although the staple food is rice, like in much of the country. Many Chhattisgarhi people drink liquor brewed from the Mahuwa flower. The tribal people of the Bastar region of Chhattisgarh eat whatever is available: Baasi(left over rice), mushrooms, bamboo pickle, bamboo vegetables, etc.
