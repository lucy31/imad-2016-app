      <h2>Andhra Pradesh</h2>
    <p>The cuisine of Andhra Pradesh belongs to the two Telugu-speaking regions of Rayalaseema and Coastal Andhra and is part of Telugu cuisine. The food of Andhra Pradesh is known for its heavy use of spices and, similar to South Indian cuisine, the use of tamarind. Seafood is common in the coastal region of the state. Rice is the staple food (as is with all South Indian states) eaten with lentil preparations like Pappu (dal) and Pulusu (Stew) and spicy vegetables or curries. In Andhra, leafy greens or vegetables like bottle-gourd and eggplant are usually added to dal. Pickles are an essential part of the local cuisine; popular among those are mango-based pickles like avakaya and maagaya, gongura (a pickle made from red sorrel leaves), usirikaya (gooseberry or amla), nimmakaya (lime) and tomato pickle. Yogurt is a common addition to meals, as a way of tempering spiciness. Breakfast items include dosa, pesarattu (mung bean dosa), vada, and idli.
